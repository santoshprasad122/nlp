Sentiment analysis deals with identifying and classifying opinions or sentiments expressed in source text. Social media is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters that are allowed in Twitter is 140. Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc. using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products.
